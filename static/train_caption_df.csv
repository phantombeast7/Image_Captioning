Also visible in this radiograph is a new temporary pacing lead that was inserted via direct axillary venous puncture access in a location outside and above the infected pacemaker pocket; the temporary pacing lead was connected to the now-externalized old pacemaker generator that was secured to the skin outside of the infected pacemaker pocket. This temporary pacing lead was necessary for the duration of antibiotic therapy prior to the new system implant because the patient was pacemaker dependent; it was placed on the same side as the infection to avoid vascular injury and localized infection in the contralateral venous access site where the new permanent pacemaker system will be implanted when the infection resolves.

Mild narrowing of the proximal superior vena cava by the necrotic mass is seen within the mediastinum. A necrotic enhancing soft-tissue mass occupies the majority of the mediastinum above the heart. This mass represents a confluence of necrotic lymphadenopathy. It is compressing the superior vena cava proximally, but the vessel remains patent. The conglomerate soft-tissue mass in the mediastinum is also pushing the pulmonary artery and aorta to the left, causing elongation and narrowing of the right pulmonary artery, and is partially compressing the right bronchus as well.
